This project is a text-based blackjack simulator designed to be played by 1-8 
people. There are no known bugs with this simulator.

I tried to make this blackjack simulator follow casino rules as much as 
possible. However, every casino has it's own rules so I generally followed the
above link's rules except where I thought the rules were abnormal or I simply
didn't like them.

This edition of blackjack follows the webite's rules except:
	dealer always stands on 17-21
	players are always paid 2:1 upon winning
	if the player and house tie the player keeps their money
	you cannot double down after splitting
	no insurance or surrender
